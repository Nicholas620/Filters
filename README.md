Signal Filter Design and Processing Tool

üöÄ About The Project

We are a passionate team of developers who have listened to the feedback of the community and are excited to present a new, powerful, and user-friendly application for signal processing and filter design! This tool allows you to easily create, visualize, and simulate both recursive and non-recursive filters, helping you analyze and manipulate signals with ease.

Whether you're a student, educator, or industry professional, our application offers a comprehensive set of features to design filters for any signal processing task. We're dedicated to improving the software continuously with community input and collaboration.

Key Features:
Signal Filtering: Design and apply recursive and non-recursive filters.
Visualizations: Real-time graphs for filter characteristics and signal analysis.
Intuitive Interface: A clean and easy-to-use interface built with PyQt.
Cross-Platform: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Extensibility: Easily extend the app with your own custom filter designs.

ü§ñ Technology Stack

Python 3.x
PyQt5 for the GUI
NumPy and SciPy for signal processing
Matplotlib for plotting graphs
Pandas for handling data (if needed)
pytest for testing
